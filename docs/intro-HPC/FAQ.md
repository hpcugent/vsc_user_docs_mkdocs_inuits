# Frequently Asked Questions 

## When will my job start?

{% if site == gent%}
See the explanation about how jobs get prioritized in [When will my job start](../running_batch_jobs/#when-will-my-job-start). 

{% else %}

In practice it's
impossible to predict when your job(s) will start, since most currently
running jobs will finish before their requested walltime expires, and
new jobs by may be submitted by other users that are assigned a higher
priority than your job(s). You can use the `showstart` command. For more
information, see .

## Can I share my account with someone else?

**NO.** You are not allowed to share your VSC account with anyone else, it is
strictly personal.

If you want to share data, there are alternatives (like a shared directories in VO
space, see [Virtual organisations](../running_jobs_with_input_output_data/#virtual-organisations)).

## Can I share my data with other {{hpc}} users?

Yes, you can use the `chmod` or `setfacl` commands to change permissions
of files so other users can access the data. For example, the following
command will enable a user named "otheruser" to read the file named
`dataset.txt`. See

<pre><code>$ <b>setfacl -m u:otheruser:r dataset.txt</b>
$ <b>ls -l dataset.txt</b>
-rwxr-x---+ 2 {{userid}} mygroup      40 Apr 12 15:00 dataset.txt
</code></pre>

For more information about `chmod` or `setfacl`, see [the section on
chmod in chapter 3 of the Linux intro
manual](../../intro-Linux/manipulating_files_and_directories/#changing-permissions-chmod).

Yes, and this is recommended when working from different computers.
Please see [Adding multiple SSH public keys](../account/#adding-multiple-ssh-public-keys-optional) on how to do this.
