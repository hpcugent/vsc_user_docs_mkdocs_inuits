This repository was used to port the VSC user documentation hosted in
[hpcugent/vsc_user_docs](https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc_user_docs) from LaTeX to MkDocs (MarkDown).

The migration was completed on 5 April 2023, see <https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc_user_docs/pull/468> .

The only reason that this repository still exists is to preserve the history of how the migration was performed.

All changes to the VSC user documentation hosted under <https://hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs> should be done
via pull requests to the [hpcugent/vsc_user_docs](https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc_user_docs) repository.
